The purpose of this code is to:

1.Compute the cost various parts of building a suspension bridge
2. To calculate the tensions in the strings of this suspension bridge.

Cost:
The cost calculation is done by taking in the physical parameters for the bridge, and multiplying the parameters to get the cost.

The Tension:
The tension calculation uses uses a matrix of the x and y components of the tension forces to get the forces necessary for static equilibrium. These are then linearlly solved to get the tension of the strings.
